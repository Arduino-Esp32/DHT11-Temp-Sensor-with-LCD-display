# DHT11-Temp-Sensor-with-LCD-display
My 2nd project 


In this project a DHT11 will get the temperature of the room and print it on the LCD. A potentiometer controls the contrast of the LCD.

This project included a LCD, DHT11 and a potentiometer all connected to an Arduino Uno.

This project included 2 libraries: A LiquidCrystal and DHT.

The DHT11 is a temperature sensor. These 3 commands make the DHT11 check the temperature: readHumidity() goes to Humidity variable, readTemperature() goes to tempF variable and readTemperature(true) goes to tempC variable.
